# Go Gin Demo

An article manager webapp built to familiarize myself with Go's Gin framework.

It currently displays book previews from Kafka's *Metamorphosis* and *The War of the Worlds* by H. G. Wells. The app responds with HTML by default, but is also capable of returning JSON or XML data.

Based on the tutorial [*Building Go Microservice with Gin and CI/CD*](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/building-go-web-applications-and-microservices-using-gin) from [Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com/).
